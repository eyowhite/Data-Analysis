# Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Analysis

The full project is available from [this link](https://eyowhite.com/how-to-analyse-electric-vehicles-adoption-rates-using-python/)

# Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in Washington State using a dataset of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered in 2024. The dataset includes details such as model year, make, model, electric vehicle type, electric range, and eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle (CAFV) incentives.

# Project Structure

## 1.	Data Loading and Initial Exploration
o	Load the dataset using pandas.
o	Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, types of data, and check for missing values.

## 2.	Summary Statistics
o	Generate summary statistics for numerical columns (Model Year, Electric Range, Base MSRP).
o	Provide an overview of categorical columns such as Electric Vehicle Type, Make, Model, and CAFV Eligibility.

## 3.	Visualiations and Analysis

o	Adoption Over Time: Visualise the number of EVs registered by model year to identify trends.
o	Geographic Distribution: Analyse the distribution of EVs across the top 20 counties in Washington.
o	Electric Range Analysis: Compare the electric range of BEVs and PHEVs.
o	CAFV Eligibility: Analyse and visualise the eligibility of vehicles for CAFV incentives, categorized by electric vehicle type.
o	Popular Makes and Models: Identify and visualise the top 10 most popular EV makes and models.
o	Legislative Districts and Electric Utility Analysis: Explore the distribution of EVs by legislative district and electric utility providers.
o	BEV vs. PHEV Adoption Trends: Compare the adoption trends of BEVs and PHEVs over time.
o	Stacked Bar Chart: Create a stacked bar chart showing CAFV eligibility by electric vehicle type.

## 4.	Code Implementation

o	The code is implemented in Python using the pandas and matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	pandas
•	matplotlib

# Key Insights

•	Adoption Trends: A significant increase in EV registrations in recent years.
•	Geographic Distribution: King County has the highest concentration of EVs.
•	CAFV Eligibility: A large proportion of BEVs are eligible for CAFV incentives, while many PHEVs are not due to low battery range.
•	Popular Models: Tesla dominates the market, with the Model Y and Model 3 being the most popular models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes detailed information on EVs registered in Washington State, including Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), model year, make, model, electric range, and eligibility for clean alternative fuel incentives.
